# Weather Outfit Discord Bot

Project created in 36 hours for the DeerHacks hackathon in 2022.

This is a Discord bot that uses [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) to get the weather, and then generate a semi-random outfit suitable for the weather.

(The idea was a combination of two prompts in the hackathon: discord bot + suggest outfit based on weather)
